\section{Midway Report}

\subsection{Problem Statement}
I will attempt to create a clustering algorithm, that can compete with, or even surpass, uClust in terms of speed, without losing precision, when working with a dataset of 500000 RNA/DNA sequences of length 500-1500.

\subsection{Analysis}
The very high number of sequences that have to be compared means that the speed of the algorithm that i develop is extraordinary. uClust is at the moment number one contender in terms of speed without loss of much precision.\\

Studies have shown that the implementation of Minhash in \cite{MinhashMapreduce} have approached both the speed and precision of uClust. This method is quite different from the centroid based approach of uClust, and therefore spurred my interest.\\

My attempt will be to apply some improvements to the Minhash implementation above, and see whether i can achieve the same speed and precision as that of uClust. This implementation i will call Max-Minhash.

\subsection{Status}

Currently i have finished the following tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Finished a prototype of my Max-Minhash algorithm. It has the following functionalities
\begin{enumerate}
\item Singlethreaded implementation of a Max-Minhash algorithm
\item A hashfunction based on the one in \cite{MinhashMapreduce}
\item Reads sequences from .seq files. 
\end{enumerate}
\item Finished a draft of the following two sections: Universal Hashing and Minhash
\end{enumerate}

What is left to be done are the following tasks

\begin{enumerate}
\item A comprehensive test of several universal hashing schemes to find a method that might be faster than the currently used one.
\item Developing the prototype so that it has the following improvements
\begin{enumerate}
\item The newfound quickest hashfunction.
\item Programmed to work in a Mapreduce framework, so that it can be run in Hadoop
\item Able to read .fasta files. Has to be able to handle sequences that contain the character N.
\end{enumerate}
\item Comprehensive tests of my algorithm in comparison to the uSearch algorithm, to see which is faster and most precise
\item As my algorithm uses K-mers as the basis for its Minhash input, a comprehensive test of which k-mer size is the most optimal for precision and speed.
\item Documenting all the tests that i perform above. 
\item Writing a conclusion.
\item Improving the sections i wrote about universal hashing, and the Minhash section
\end{enumerate}

It should be noted that quite a few of these tasks can be completed without having 2.b ready, read. 1, 2.c, and 4. These will therefore be done parallel to implementing the Mapreduce framework, some using the current prototype.

\subsection{Time plan}
