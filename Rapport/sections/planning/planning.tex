\section*{1 - Plan for subjects}
These plans are made according to the 8 subjects that are mentioned in the Midway Report. They were written as i had to commence each subject, so that i had a plan of actions to tackle the subjects.
\begin{enumerate}
\item (1) Test of universal hashing schemes\\
{\bf Date}: 22 April 2015.\\
\noindent {\bf Goal}: To test several hashing schemes, and see which is quickest.\\
\noindent {\bf Procedure}: I shall first find 3 different hashing schemes. These will most probably be inspired by the research done in \cite{thorupEven}, and by the universal hashing section i have written.

For testing, i shall use three different fasta files of different sizes. These are to be found in the directory given by Sune, wherein a lot of fasta files are located. 

Before testing, i must program each hashing function. This should no be too difficult as i have a working prototype running, so all that has to be done is copy the working implementation for each hash function and change is so that it applies another hash function. 

Finally i shall have my java program write into a file the results of each run, so that i can create a table of the runtimes of each hashfunction. 

When the table is complete i can begin commenting on my results and see which hashfunction to use.
\end{enumerate}
