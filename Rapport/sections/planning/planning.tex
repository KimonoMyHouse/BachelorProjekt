\section*{1 - Plan for subjects}
These plans are made according to the 8 subjects that are mentioned in the Midway Report. They were written as i had to commence each subject, so that i had a plan of actions to tackle the subjects.
\begin{enumerate}
\item (1) Test of universal hashing schemes\\
{\bf Date}: 22 April 2015.\\
\noindent {\bf Goal}: To test several hashing schemes, and see which is quickest.\\
\noindent {\bf Procedure}: I shall use the two hash functions i defined in my universal hashing section.

For testing, i shall use three different fasta files of different sizes. These are to be found in the directory given by Sune, wherein a lot of fasta files are located. 

Before testing, i must program both hashing function. This should no be too difficult as i have a working prototype running, so all that has to be done is copy the working implementation of the first hash function and change is so that it applies to the other hash function. 

Finally i shall have my java program write into a file the results of each run, so that i can create a table of the runtimes of each hashfunction. 

When the table is complete i can begin commenting on my results and see which hashfunction to use.
\end{enumerate}
